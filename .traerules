# .traerules - Ride or Drive Weather Project Intelligence

## Project Context
**Project**: Motorcycle Weather App (Ride or Drive Weather)
**Stage**: UI reorganization and user experience enhancement completed
**Last Updated**: Checkpoint - Icon cropping issue resolved by replacing adaptive icon system

## Development Patterns

### Flutter Project Structure
- **Standard Layout**: Following Flutter conventions with lib/, android/, ios/, web/, macos/
- **Entry Point**: main.dart as single source of truth for app initialization
- **Material Design 3**: Using ColorScheme.fromSeed for consistent theming
- **Multi-platform**: All platforms configured and ready

### Code Organization Preferences
- **Current**: Single file approach (main.dart) for simplicity
- **Future**: Feature-based organization recommended as app grows
- **Naming**: snake_case for files, PascalCase for classes
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive memory bank system established

### State Management Evolution
```
Current: setState() → Next: Provider/Riverpod → Complex: Bloc
```

### Architecture Progression
```
Simple Widget → MVVM → Clean Architecture (as complexity grows)
```

## Optimization Patterns Learned

### ServiceManager Architecture
- **Pattern**: Centralized service access via singleton ServiceManager
- **Implementation**: `ServiceManager.instance.getService<T>()` for type-safe service retrieval
- **Benefits**: Eliminates service bundle complexity, improves maintainability
- **Key Files**: service_manager.dart, main.dart (initializeAll)
- **Screen Integration**: All screens (home, debug, settings) use ServiceManager

### Code Optimization Strategies
- **Import Optimization**: Remove duplicates while maintaining type declarations
- **Service Consolidation**: Eliminate intermediate service bundle classes
- **Centralized Initialization**: Single point of service initialization in main.dart
- **Performance**: Lazy loading of services through ServiceManager
- **Maintainability**: Simplified service access patterns across all screens

### UI Organization Patterns
- **Settings Placement**: Background/monitoring controls belong in settings, not main screen
- **Home Screen Focus**: Main screen should prioritize informational content over controls

### Icon System Patterns
- **Android Adaptive Icons**: Cause automatic cropping due to background/foreground layer system
- **Cropping Solution**: Replace adaptive icon XML files with direct PNG usage in mipmap folders
- **Cross-Platform Icons**: Use assets/icon.png as source of truth for both Android and iOS
- **Android Implementation**: Copy to all density folders (hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- **iOS Implementation**: Replace key AppIcon.appiconset files (60x60@2x, 60x60@3x, 1024x1024@1x)
- **Build Integration**: Requires flutter clean after icon changes for proper application

### Background Handling Patterns - NEW LEARNINGS
- **Location Caching Strategy**: 6-hour cache prevents GPS timeouts when app is backgrounded/killed
- **Permission Sequencing**: Always request basic location first, then background location for Android 10+
- **Fallback Chain Implementation**: GPS → Last Known Position → Cached Location → Graceful Error
- **Retry Logic**: 2 retries with delays essential for background weather API calls
- **Timeout Management**: 10-second GPS timeout prevents indefinite waiting in background
- **SharedPreferences Enhancement**: getDouble/setDouble methods required for coordinate caching
- **AndroidManifest Updates**: ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION permission critical for Android 10+ background operation
- **Error Resolution**: TimeoutException in background resolved through comprehensive fallback system
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent caching reduces battery usage and improves user experience
- **Educational Content**: Weather assessment guides improve user understanding and engagement
- **State Management**: Settings changes require proper state persistence via preferences
- **Code Cleanup**: Moving features requires thorough cleanup of unused variables and imports

### User Experience Insights
- **Feature Discovery**: Settings screen is appropriate for advanced/background features
- **Information Hierarchy**: Weather categories and explanations are valuable on main screen
- **Color Coding**: Visual weather category system (Perfect/Good/Okay/Bad/Dangerous) enhances usability
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex controls in settings, simple information on home screen

### Refactoring Lessons
- **Type Safety**: Keep service imports for variable declarations even when using ServiceManager
- **Build Validation**: Always test compilation after major architectural changes
- **Import Cleanup**: Remove non-existent imports to prevent compilation errors
- **Feature Migration**: Moving UI components requires updating state management and cleanup
- **Incremental Changes**: Apply optimizations systematically across all affected files
- **Documentation**: Update memory bank immediately after major refactoring

## Development Workflow

### Memory Bank System
- **Critical**: Always read memory bank files at session start
- **Structure**: 6 core files (projectbrief, productContext, activeContext, systemPatterns, techContext, progress)
- **Updates**: Update after significant changes or when user requests "update memory bank"
- **Purpose**: Maintains context across sessions due to memory resets

### File Management
- **Absolute Paths**: Always use full Windows paths (c:\Users\igeor\AndroidStudioProjects\Ride_or_Drive\...)
- **Directory Structure**: Maintain Flutter conventions
- **Memory Bank**: Keep in /memory-bank/ directory at project root

### Development Approach
- **Incremental**: Build features step by step
- **Documentation First**: Update memory bank before major changes
- **Best Practices**: Follow Flutter and Dart conventions
- **Cross-platform**: Ensure compatibility across all supported platforms

## Technical Preferences

### Dependencies Management
- **Minimal Start**: Begin with essential dependencies only
- **Gradual Addition**: Add dependencies as features require them
- **Version Pinning**: Use caret constraints (^) for flexibility
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: flutter_lints package enabled
- **Analysis**: Run flutter analyze regularly
- **Testing**: Implement tests alongside features
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic

### Performance Considerations
- **const Constructors**: Use where possible for performance
- **Widget Keys**: Add when needed for widget identity
- **Hot Reload**: Leverage for fast development cycles
- **Build Optimization**: Monitor as app complexity grows

## Project-Specific Intelligence
