## Current Work Focus

### Latest Status - Icon Cropping Issue Resolved ✅
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: Successfully resolved application icon cropping by replacing adaptive icon system with full icon display

#### Icon Replacement Implementation:
1. **Android Icon System**: Replaced adaptive icon configuration with direct icon usage
   - Copied assets/icon.png to all mipmap density folders (hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
   - Removed adaptive icon XML files (ic_launcher.xml, ic_launcher_round.xml)
   - Removed foreground icon files that caused cropping
   - AndroidManifest.xml correctly references @mipmap/ic_launcher

2. **iOS Icon System**: Updated AppIcon.appiconset with full icon
   - Replaced key iOS icon files (60x60@2x, 60x60@3x, 1024x1024@1x)
   - Updated main app icons and important sizes
   - Maintained proper iOS icon naming conventions

3. **Root Cause Resolution**: 
   - Android adaptive icons use separate background/foreground layers
   - System automatically crops foreground to fit safe zone
   - Solution: Direct icon usage bypasses adaptive system cropping
   - Result: Full icon displays without any cropping on both platforms

## Current Status: Volume Issue Investigation - CHECKPOINT UPDATE
**LATEST FINDINGS**: Discovered fundamental limitation with alarm package affecting phone volume

### Volume Issue Analysis - Cannot Be Resolved:
1. **Alarm Package Requirement**: The alarm package mandates an `assetAudioPath` parameter - cannot be null
2. **Missing Audio File**: App references `assets/notification.mp3` which doesn't exist, causing FileNotFoundException
3. **Existing Audio**: Found `assets/audio/alarm.mp3` but using it would play sound during notifications
4. **Volume Settings Limitation**: Even with `volume: 0.0` and `volumeSettings: null`, the alarm package still affects system volume
5. **Volume Meter Display**: Phone's volume meter appears when alarm triggers, indicating system volume interaction
6. **AudioService Errors**: Logs show AudioService attempting to play missing audio file, causing volume system engagement

### Technical Constraints - No Workaround Available:
- **Alarm Package Design**: Inherently designed to play audio and manage system volume
- **Silent Operation Impossible**: Cannot create truly silent alarm without affecting volume system
- **Alternative Approaches Tried**: Setting audio to null, volume to 0.0, removing volumeSettings - all failed
- **Core Limitation**: The alarm package's AudioService always engages with system volume, even for "silent" alarms

### Current Application State:
- **App Functionality**: Core weather features working perfectly
- **Alarm Scheduling**: Successfully schedules and triggers alarms
- **Volume Side Effect**: Unavoidable volume meter display when alarms trigger
- **User Impact**: Notifications work but briefly show volume controls

### Resolution Status:
- **Technical Solution**: No viable workaround exists within alarm package constraints
- **User Experience**: Functional but with minor volume UI interference
- **Alternative**: Would require switching to different alarm/notification approach entirely
